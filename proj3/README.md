# Build Your Own World Design Document

**Partner 1:**

**Partner 2:**

## Classes and Data Structures
- world generation class
- track rooms and see how they're unique
- randomized world
## Algorithms
- 2D Array?
- hallway generation
- disjoint sets
- weighted quick union
- use connected to see if hallways are connected
- the find method would find the root of the disjoint set which
  would be the room that's connected to the hallways
## Persistence
